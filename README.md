# 🎯 RFID-Based Attendance System

This project introduces a **Smart Attendance System** powered by **RFID technology** and **real-time cloud integration** to streamline attendance management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system combines **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** with **Google Sheets** to enable **automated, accurate, and real-time attendance recording**.

Each user is assigned an RFID tag containing:
- 📛 Name
- 🔢 Roll Number
- 📍 Location
- 🏫 Affiliation

These tags are scanned at entry points using **RFID readers**. The data is then instantly pushed to a **Google Sheet** via a connected **Google Apps Script**, including a precise **timestamp** — creating a seamless digital attendance record.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Real-Time Recording  
✅ Cloud-Based (Google Sheets) Integration  
✅ Accurate Timestamps  
✅ Hands-Free & Contactless Operation  
✅ Scalable Across Institutions  
✅ Improved Efficiency & Error Reduction

In schools, universities, and offices, traditional attendance systems are often:
- ❌ Error-prone
- ❌ Time-consuming
- ❌ Privacy-invasive

Our RFID-based system offers:
- 🔐 Secure logging  
- ⚡ Fast scanning  
- 📈 Efficient data handling  
- ☁️ Anywhere accessibility

</div>

1. **Tag Assignment**: Each individual receives an RFID card with stored personal data.  
2. **Scan at Entry**: RFID readers placed at gates or doors read the tag information.  
3. **Data Transfer**: Microcontroller triggers a Google Apps Script to send data to Sheets.  
4. **Instant Log**: The attendance record is updated in real-time with a timestamp.
